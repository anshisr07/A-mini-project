# A-mini-project
This mini-project simulates how real-world traffic signals operate by visually showing the transitions between each light. This project is made using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. It demonstrates how the traffic light changes automatically at fixed time intervals, helping vehicles move safely and reducing road congestion.
